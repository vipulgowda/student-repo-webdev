          Hey ðŸ‘‹, My name is Vipul, and I am currently pursuing my master's in
          computer science. I am more inclined towards web development and would
          like to explore new web development frameworks and libraries.
          Previously, I worked as a software engineer at The Modern Data
          Company, where we developed data platforms. I am still learning how to
          craft beer, and my hobbies include going on trails and road trips with
          friends.
